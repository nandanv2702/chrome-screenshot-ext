# Screenshot - A Chrome Extension
A lot of times I've had to manually crop a screenshot of my screen to get an acceptable "screenshot" of my browser window. This is really time consuming, so I decided to make a chrome extension that can take a screenshot of your viewport with the click of a button. 

## How do I use this?

### Step 1: Download
Run this command to clone the repo to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/nandanv2702/chrome-screenshot-ext.git
```
### Step 2: Installation
Go to ```chrome://extensions``` on Google Chrome and toggle the 'Developer Mode' to 'on.'
Then, select 'Load Unpacked,' navigate to the cloned folder and select it.

### Step 3: Getting it to work
Once installation is complete, it might not show up on the 'Extensions' tab in Chrome. To solve this, click the 'Extensions' button and pin 'Screenshot Ext.'

Now, you should be able to see a retro camera icon. Anytime you'd like to screenshot a tab, click the camera icon. This should open a new window with an image of your viewport which you can then save to your local machine by right clicking and selecting 'Save Image As...'
